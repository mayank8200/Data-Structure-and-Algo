 # About the Repository
 This repository is for all those people who want to learn Data Structures and Algorithms from basic to advance level. We don't expect you   to have any prior knowledge of Data Structure and Algorithms, but a basic prior knowledge of any programming language ( C++ / Java) will   be helpful.
 I am currently building this repository. I will daily post some interview problems solution here. The code is in C++ language.
